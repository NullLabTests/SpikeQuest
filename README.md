# SpikeQuest: Path to AGI with Spiking Neural Networks

## Overview
SpikeQuest is a research project exploring artificial general intelligence (AGI) using spiking neural networks (SNNs). It simulates an intelligent agent navigating a 5x5 grid world from (0,0) to (4,4), aiming to mimic AGI-like behavior through novelty, reward-based learning, and pathfinding. The agent uses STDP, rewards, and exploration to learn optimal paths while avoiding obstacles.

## Files
- : Core SNN implementation for grid navigation, reaching the goal at step 19.
- : Enhanced version with grid visualization and advanced features, showing path progress (e.g., Step 14 grid).
- : Experimental script for deeper AGI concepts, including step-like progress tracking.

Total Reward: 3.0 for visualizations.

## Visualizations
- **Step-Like Graph**: Tracks cumulative progress (e.g., Figure 1, reaching 4.0 at step 19).
- **Grid Visualization**: Shows the agentâ€™s path on a 5x5 grid, color-coded (green=new, orange=visited, red=obstacle, green=goal).
